# üß™ Sickle Cell Disease Detector & Visual Question Answering (VQA)

This AI-powered medical tool detects **sickle cell disease** from blood smear images and answers natural-language questions related to the disease. It combines **image classification**, **cell highlighting**, and **medical question-answering** into one powerful diagnostic interface.

## üìå Key Features

‚úÖ Classifies blood smear images as:
- **Sickle Cell**
- **Normal Cell**

‚úÖ Highlights **abnormal sickle-shaped cells** in the image using image processing.

‚úÖ Accepts **natural-language questions** like:
- *‚ÄúIs it inherited?‚Äù*
- *‚ÄúWhat are the symptoms?‚Äù*
- *‚ÄúCan I travel with sickle cell?‚Äù*
- *‚ÄúShow me sickle cells in this image‚Äù*

‚úÖ Provides **personalized, medical-grade answers** using AI-powered VQA logic.

## üß† Model Training (DenseNet121)

We used **DenseNet121**, a deep convolutional neural network pretrained on **ImageNet**, and fine-tuned it on labeled blood smear images.

- Input size: `224x224`
- Classification: Binary
  - `1` ‚Üí Sickle Cell
  - `0` ‚Üí Normal Cell
- Framework: **TensorFlow / Keras**
- Final model saved as: `model_fold5.h5`

> DenseNet121 was chosen for its efficiency and ability to retain detailed features in medical images.

## üî¨ Image Analysis

- Uploaded images are processed through the trained DenseNet121 model
- Model returns:
  - **Predicted label**
  - **Confidence score**
- Sickle cells are visually highlighted using OpenCV:
  - **Red boxes** ‚Üí Severe sickling
  - **Orange boxes** ‚Üí Moderate sickling

## ü§ñ Visual Question Answering (VQA)

Users can ask **natural-language questions**, and the app responds based on:
- The uploaded image
- Model prediction
- Question intent

VQA covers 40+ question types, such as:
- Symptoms
- Cure options
- Inheritance
- Pain crisis
- Diet
- Travel
- Growth/fertility
- Early signs in children
- Treatment risks (temporary & permanent)
- Bone marrow transplant
- Ayurvedic remedies
- ‚Ä¶and many more!
